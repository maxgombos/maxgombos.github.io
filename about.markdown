**Hello! Iâ€™m Max Gombos**
, a mechanical engineering student at the University of Connecticut, avid hiker, year-round camper, and novice blacksmith from southern Connecticut. I am an aspiring engineer with interests in product design, transportation, and systems engineering. I hope to find ways to build a career making use of my love for engineering to make the world a little better than when I found it.  
Much of my experience through the years has been gained from my involvement with the Boy Scouts. My time in scouting has helped broaden my perspective of the world, allowing me to meet and work with people from all over the country and across the globe. Many of these people have served as critical mentors in both my personal and professional lives, helping me to build strong leadership and public speaking skills.  
In recent years I have focused on developing the more technical skills I can bring to the table. Working with computers is something I have been comfortable with for a while now, having built many for myself, friends, and family. Through my past internships, I have gained experience managing them in a professional setting, along with proficiency in a variety of programming languages. I also have experience in part design and manufacturing. Whether it be through CAD or hand drafting, I have learned how to efficiently turn an idea into a finalized design.  
As I continue to learn and grow professionally, I am excited to see how I can leverage these skills and experiences of mine in real world problems. I look forward to working with others who continue to push boundaries and develop innovative solutions to problems.
